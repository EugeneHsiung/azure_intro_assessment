## Part 2: Azure Exploration

#### Storage Services: 

1. **Azure Backup**: This service provides a simple, secure, and cost-effective backup method to back up or recover lost information in the Microsoft Azure cloud. It can restore and backup files, folders, SQL databases, etc. The backup protects from ransomware attacks through various preventive measures and tools. This backup also has three types of replication (Locally redundant storage, Geo-redundant storage, Zone- redundant storage) to keep the storage and data available. Python can be used to leverage Azure backups by installing the SDK kit and having Python manage the backup storages by adding or deleting the storages. Python can then also be used to manage the backup policy to edit the duration of the information.
   
2. **Microsoft Azure confidential ledger**: This service is highly secure and manages sensitive data records. It runs on hardware-backed secure enclaves. This offers data integrity, tamper-proofing, and immutability which ensures records are not modified. On the ledger, one can store business transactions, trusted assets, administration control settings, and operational and security events. Similar to the Azure backup, python could be used to manage the data, retrieve the data, and verify the integrtiy of the data. The python code could also be used to add the functions of who can access the data or analyze the ledger data.
